**HAL2Arduino**
==============

HAL2Arduino is firmware and glue software written for the Arduino Uno and Due to allow a person with an old USB enabled computer and a free copy of LinuxCNC to begin building their very own CNC machine cheaply and quickly with a variety of components, ranging from low-end inexpensive (even salvaged) components such as old steppers and computer parts to high-end linear servos.
